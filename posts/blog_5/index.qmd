Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve been building a collection of R packages that span a range of topics from data processing to sports analytics, machine learning, and visualization tools.

To celebrate (and to keep them visually organized), I decided to use the `hexsession` package to bring all my package hex stickers together into a single, beautiful tile.

Hereâ€™s the code I used (try it out with the interactivity by clicking on hexstickers):

```{r}
library(hexsession)

make_tile(
  packages = c(
    "airpurifyr", 
    "cardinalR", 
    "DSjobtracker", 
    "MedLEA", 
    "olympics", 
    "quollr"
  ),
  local_images = c(
    here::here("hexstickers/airpurifyr.png"),
    here::here("hexstickers/cardinalR.png"),
    here::here("hexstickers/DSjobtracker.png"),
    here::here("hexstickers/MedLEA.png"),
    here::here("hexstickers/matcharoo.png"),
    here::here("hexstickers/olympics.png"),
    here::here("hexstickers/quollr.png")
  ),
  local_urls = c(
    "https://numbats.github.io/airpurifyr/",
    "https://github.com/JayaniLakshika/cardinalR",
    "https://github.com/thiyangt/DSjobtracker",
    "https://github.com/SMART-Research/MedLEA",
    "https://github.com/JayaniLakshika/Match-a-roo",
    "https://github.com/numbats/olympics",
    "https://github.com/JayaniLakshika/quollr"
  ),
  dark_mode = TRUE
)

```

### ðŸ§© Whatâ€™s happening here?

* **`packages`**: The names of all my R packages.
* **`local_images`**: The paths to my hex sticker images (stored locally).
* **`local_urls`**: Optional â€” you can link the stickers to package websites or GitHub repos.

When you run this, you get a **tiled display of all your package stickers**, perfect for slides, blogs, or social media.

ðŸ’¡ Why I Like This

This kind of visual summary is a quick personal portfolio. Whether youâ€™re introducing yourself at a conference or sharing your work on social media, having all your package logos together is eye-catching and memorable.
