You can find my **first** project, which I have completed as a pert of the course **STA 474 2.0 Statistical Consultancy**, when I was doing my undergraduate degree. This was the first challenge that I have to face when I was in the second semester of my last year. I was never build a blog post by myself back then. This was a great experience for me. Finally, it's in the Statistical Consultancy Website of University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Sri Lanka (**SCS-USJ**).
