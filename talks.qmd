## Australian Statistical Conference (ASC 2025) (Perth, Western Australia)

I attended my second **ASC Conference**, where I had the opportunity to present my research and engage in thoughtful discussions with fellow statisticians. My presentation, **“Visualise your fitted non-linear dimension reduction model in the high-dimensional data space”**, showcased a methodological and software-based approach for examining how non-linear dimension reduction (NLDR) techniques reshape high-dimensional data. The experience was both intellectually stimulating and professionally rewarding.

## Biometrics in the Bush Capital (BIBC2025) (Canberra, Australia)

I had the pleasure of attending my first **BIBC conference**, where I presented my work to an engaged and inspiring audience. My talk, **"Visualise your fitted non-linear dimension reduction model in the high-dimensional data space"**, introduced a method and accompanying software to visualise how non-linear dimension reduction (NLDR) transforms high-dimensional data. It was a rewarding experience to share my research and connect with the wider statistical community.

## useR! 2025 (North Carolina, USA)

At useR! 2025 (Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA), I presented **Generating interesting high-dimensional data structures**. High-dimensional datasets—where each observation is described by many features can contain intricate shapes such as nonlinear manifolds, clusters, and sparse patterns. Using mathematical functions and statistical distributions, we can create a wide range of structures, from spirals and donuts to complex curved surfaces. These synthetic datasets are invaluable for testing and improving dimensionality reduction, clustering, and visualisation methods. My talk will showcase techniques for generating such data and introduce the `cardinalR` package, which organises a rich collection of functions and examples.

## Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM), 2025 (Nashville, USA)

I attended my first JSM conference and had the opportunity to present both a lightning talk and an electronic poster (E-poster). My presentation, titled **Visualise your fitted non-linear dimension reduction model in the high-dimensional data space**, focused on developing a method and software to visualise how NLDR warps the data. It was a rewarding experience to share my work and engage with the wider statistical community.

## UNO Data Science Club, 2024 (Omaha, USA)

During my visit to the USA, I had the privilege of presenting our latest development of the high-d-vis algorithm on **November 22, 2024**, at the Data Science Club, University of Nebraska, Omaha (UNO).

I am sincerely grateful to A/Prof. Md Mahbubul Majumder and the Data Science Club for the kind invitation and the opportunity to share my work with such an engaging and enthusiastic audience. This experience allowed me to connect with fellow data science enthusiasts and exchange ideas on cutting-edge developments in the field.

## Graphics Group Presentation, 2024 (Nebraska, USA)

During my visit to the USA, I had the privilege of presenting our latest development of the high-d-vis algorithm on **November 13, 2024**, at the Graphics Group seminar. You can find details about the session [here](https://isu-graphicsgroup.github.io/gg-blog/posts/2024-Fall/2024-11-13-quollr/).

I am deeply grateful to Prof. Heike Hofmann and Yuhang (Tom) Lin for inviting me to share my work with the group. It was an excellent opportunity to engage in meaningful discussions and receive valuable feedback from a community passionate about data visualization and analytics.
