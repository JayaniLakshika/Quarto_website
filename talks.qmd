## Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM), 2025 (Nashville, USA)

I attended my first JSM conference and had the opportunity to present both a lightning talk and an electronic poster (E-poster). My presentation, titled **Visualise your fitted non-linear dimension reduction model in the high-dimensional data space**, focused on developing a method and software to visualise how NLDR warps the data. It was a rewarding experience to share my work and engage with the wider statistical community.
