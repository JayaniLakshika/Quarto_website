## Monash Innovation Guarantee-Postgraduate (MIG-P)

In July 2025, I had the privilege of serving as a coach in the Monash Innovation Guarantee Postgraduate (MIG-P) program. Over three inspiring weeks, I worked with a diverse cohort of master’s students as they tackled real-world, industry-defined challenges. It was an incredible experience to support their journey from exploration and ideation through to prototyping and pitching—witnessing their creativity, resilience, and ability to thrive in ambiguity.
