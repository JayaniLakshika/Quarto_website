## In the second year of my PhD

In July 2024, I had the privilege of visiting A/Prof. Ursula Laa at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna (BOKU University), accompanied by Prof. Di Cook, Prof. Eun-Kyung Lee, and A/Prof. Natalia da Silva. This visit was a valuable learning experience, where I had the opportunity to engage with the visitors, the academic staff and students at BOKU University and gain insights into their research work. I received constructive feedback on how to enhance my work and how it can contribute to their ongoing projects. I am deeply grateful to my main supervisor, Prof. Di Cook, for organizing this visit, and to A/Prof. Ursula Laa for graciously inviting me.

## In the Third Year of My PhD  

From late October to late December 2024, I had the incredible opportunity to visit Prof. Heike Hofmann, A/Prof. Susan Vanderplas, and Dr. Michelle Graham at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, USA (UNL).  

During my time there, I presented my research to their group, sharing insights into high-dimensional data visualization and dimension reduction techniques. I also actively participated in the Nebraska R User Group meetings and the Graphics Group discussions ([Graphics Group Blog](https://isu-graphicsgroup.github.io/gg-blog/)), which provided enriching experiences and opportunities for collaboration.  

I am deeply grateful to my main supervisor, Prof. Di Cook, for organizing this visit, and to Prof. Heike Hofmann and A/Prof. Susan Vanderplas for graciously inviting me. I would also like to thank Dr. Michelle Graham for taking the time to visit me while I was there.
