## Second year in my PhD

In July 2024, I had the privilege of visiting A/Prof. Ursula Laa at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna (BOKU University), accompanied by Prof. Di Cook, Prof. Eun-Kyung Lee, and A/Prof. Natalia da Silva. This visit was a valuable learning experience, where I had the opportunity to engage with the visitors, the academic staff and students at BOKU University and gain insights into their research work. I received constructive feedback on how to enhance my work and how it can contribute to their ongoing projects. I am deeply grateful to my main supervisor, Prof. Di Cook, for organizing this visit, and to A/Prof. Ursula Laa for graciously inviting me.
