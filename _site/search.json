    "text": "Medicinal plants are usually identified by practitioners based on years of experience through sensory or olfactory senses. The other method of recognizing these plants involves laboratory-based testing, which requires trained skills, data interpretation which is costly and time-intensive. Automatic ways to identify medicinal plants are useful especially those that are lacking experience in herbal recognition. There is no standard mechanism in identification of medicinal plants. Therefore, we introduce an automatic approach based on statistical machine learning to identify medicinal plants. We refer to our medicinal plant classification algorithm as MEDIPI : MEDIicinal Plant Identitication. Our classification algorithm operates on the features extracted from the image leaves.\nwebsite"

Therefore, MARGIN parameter should be 1, STATS should be 3, and the FUN should be +.\n\n\nExample 2: Substract a value by column\n\ndata_example_1 <- sweep(x = data_matrix, MARGIN = 2, STATS = -3, FUN = \"-\")\ndata_example_1\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    3    3    3\n[2,]    3    3    3\n[3,]    3    3    3\n[4,]    3    3    3\n[5,]    3    3    3\n\n\nIn this example, the output is same as in Example 1, but the operation is different. That is, in here, the specific value, - is subtracted by each element of the matrix by column.\n\nLet’s see more complex example to understand what is happening.\n\n\nExample 3: Add set of values by column\n\ndata_example_3 <- sweep(x = data_matrix, MARGIN = 2, STATS = c(1, 3, 5), FUN = \"+\")\ndata_example_3\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    3    5\n[2,]    1    3    5\n[3,]    1    3    5\n[4,]    1    3    5\n[5,]    1    3    5\n\n\nThis example shows how to perform column-wise operation for a matrix. In here, the value of the first element of STATS, 1 is added to all the elements of first column, the value of the second element of STATS, 3 is added to all the elements of second column, and so on.\nWhat if the number of elements in STATS parameter is less than the number of columns in the matrix.\n\n\nExample 4\n\ndata_example_4 <- sweep(x = data_matrix, MARGIN = 2, STATS = c(1, 3), FUN = \"+\")\n\nWarning in sweep(x = data_matrix, MARGIN = 2, STATS = c(1, 3), FUN = \"+\"): STATS\ndoes not recycle exactly across MARGIN\n\ndata_example_4\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    3    1\n[2,]    3    1    3\n[3,]    1    3    1\n[4,]    3    1    3\n[5,]    1    3    1\n\n\nConsider the warning message that we are getting. But still, we are receiving an output. However, the operation recycled across the end of each column.\nUsually you should try to avoid this by specifying the length of STATS equal to the number of rows/columns."
