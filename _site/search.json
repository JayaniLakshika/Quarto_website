Therefore, MARGIN parameter should be 1, STATS should be 3, and the FUN should be +.\n\n\nExample 2: Substract a value by column\n\ndata_example_1 <- sweep(x = data_matrix, MARGIN = 2, STATS = -3, FUN = \"-\")\ndata_example_1\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    3    3    3\n[2,]    3    3    3\n[3,]    3    3    3\n[4,]    3    3    3\n[5,]    3    3    3\n\n\nIn this example, the output is same as in Example 1, but the operation is different. That is, in here, the specific value, - is subtracted by each element of the matrix by column.\n\nLet’s see more complex example to understand what is happening.\n\n\nExample 3: Add set of values by column\n\ndata_example_3 <- sweep(x = data_matrix, MARGIN = 2, STATS = c(1, 3, 5), FUN = \"+\")\ndata_example_3\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    3    5\n[2,]    1    3    5\n[3,]    1    3    5\n[4,]    1    3    5\n[5,]    1    3    5\n\n\nThis example shows how to perform column-wise operation for a matrix. In here, the value of the first element of STATS, 1 is added to all the elements of first column, the value of the second element of STATS, 3 is added to all the elements of second column, and so on.\nWhat if the number of elements in STATS parameter is less than the number of columns in the matrix.\n\n\nExample 4\n\ndata_example_4 <- sweep(x = data_matrix, MARGIN = 2, STATS = c(1, 3), FUN = \"+\")\n\nWarning in sweep(x = data_matrix, MARGIN = 2, STATS = c(1, 3), FUN = \"+\"): STATS\ndoes not recycle exactly across MARGIN\n\ndata_example_4\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    3    1\n[2,]    3    1    3\n[3,]    1    3    1\n[4,]    3    1    3\n[5,]    1    3    1\n\n\nConsider the warning message that we are getting.

    "text": "Where do I need to start?\nFirst, you must decide whether to do a Master’s or a Ph.D. because it will depend on the country or university where you will apply. In this blog post, I am sharing my journey in applying for a Ph.D.\nNext, I searched the country that offered direct Ph.D. For example, Australia and New Zealand do have.\nAfter that, list down the universities according to their world and country rankings.\nAt the same time, you need to consider your research interests. Sometimes it will take time to decide what they are. You can ask your lecturers, who always know what you are good at. It always helps to determine.\nNow you have universities and your research interests. Then, you can visit the university websites and find which department or school has researchers with the same research interests.
